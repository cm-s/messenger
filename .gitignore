# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundle history, byebug, temps, logs, squlite3 dbs.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
.byebug_history
